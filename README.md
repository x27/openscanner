### Purpose of Custom Firmware

The main purpose at the current stage is to support decryption of encrypted voice channels in the presence of an encryption key.

Additionally, the firmware has minor tweaks that make using the scanner more convenient.

  - This is indicated on the scanner's second boot screen.
