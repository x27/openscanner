### Sentinel (Control Software)

pss. patched sentinel (2.05.03) .exe file for support scanners with mod fw located here: https://mega.nz/file/NBtlRKxC#54LBK3Qiuqtsd0ZzQWZ_SfnRTqukdHuPXGChtUu5mXY

### How To Flash

To flash the Firmware, download the firmware to the computer.

Connect the Scanner to the computer as Mass Storage (Press "E" on the Scanner).

Copy the Firmware to the "\BCDx36HP\firmware" directory of the Scanner's memory card (for example, E:\BCDx36HP\firmware).

Wait till the copy process is done.

Safely disconnect the Scanner from the computer and wait about half a minute for the Firmware to automatically flash and for the Scanner to start working.

### Revert To Official Version

Custom Firmware doesn't change the bootloader so you can go back to the official version.

Since custom firmware does not change the internal version number, you can go back to the official firmware as follows:
- download the latest official firmware (1.28.16) from [here](https://github.com/x27/openscanner/tree/main/uniden/bcd536hp/fw/official)
- rename the file to BCD536HP_V1_28_17.BIN. This is necessary for the bootloader to accept this firmware version as the new one.
- copy to the scanner directory /BCDx36HP/FIRMWARE and reboot the scanner.
